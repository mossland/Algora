### Phase 10.5: Performance Optimization (COMPLETED)

#### Mobile Responsiveness Fixes (COMPLETED)
- [x] Issue/Proposal/Treasury/Disclosure/Engine Room pages mobile UI
- [x] Modal layouts with proper scroll structure
- [x] Grid responsive breakpoints (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2)
- [x] Text truncation and overflow handling
- [x] Live page header overflow fix
- [x] Proposal modal proposer address and budget overflow fix
- [x] Treasury tabs horizontal scroll
- [x] Engine Room refresh button visual feedback

#### Initial Load Performance (RSC Migration) (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Dashboard RSC Conversion**
  - [x] `lib/server-api.ts` - Server-side fetch utilities with timeout
  - [x] `DashboardClient.tsx` - Client component for interactive features
  - [x] `page.tsx` converted to async Server Component
  - [x] `ActivityFeed` and `AgentLobbyPreview` accept `initialData` prop
  - [x] Data fetched on server, pre-rendered into HTML
  - [x] React Query handles real-time updates after hydration

#### TTFB Bottleneck Resolution (COMPLETED)

- [x] `API_INTERNAL_URL` environment variable in PM2 config
- [x] 3-second timeout with AbortController to prevent blocking
- [x] **Dynamic Icon Removal**: Deleted `icon.tsx` (ImageResponse), replaced with static `favicon.svg`

- [x] **Server-Timing Headers**: Added to API for performance diagnostics
- [x] **Slow Request Logging**: Console warning for requests > 500ms
- [x] `deploy/nginx.conf.example` - Example nginx config with proxy caching
- [x] `deploy/warmup.sh` - Cold start mitigation script

### Phase 10.6: Operational Data Analysis & Improvements (COMPLETED)

Based on 13 days of production data (2026-01-09 ~ 2026-01-21):

#### Data Analysis Results
- **activity_log**: 129,974 records (~10,000/day)
- **agent_chatter**: 32,900 records (~2,500/day)
- **agora_messages**: 21,983 records (~1,700/day)
- **signals**: 14,935 records (~1,150/day)
- **Database Size**: 141MB (estimated ~4GB/year without cleanup)

#### LLM Cost Tracking (P0) - COMPLETED
- [x] `generation` event listener in `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- [x] Records all LLM calls to `budget_usage` table
- [x] Tracks provider, tier, tokens, and estimated cost
- [x] Upsert pattern aggregates by provider/tier/date/hour

#### Ollama Timeout Optimization (P0) - COMPLETED
- [x] Increased timeout from 60s to 120s for large models like qwen2.5:32b
- [x] Hybrid model strategy verified:
  - Chatter uses `complexity: 'fast'` → `llama3.2:3b`
  - Agora uses `complexity: 'balanced'` → `qwen2.5:32b`

#### Data Retention Service (P1) - COMPLETED
- [x] New service: `apps/api/src/services/data-retention.ts`
- [x] Standard 30-day retention policy:
  - `activity_log`: 30 days (HEARTBEAT: 7 days)
  - `agent_chatter`: 90 days
  - `signals`: 90 days
  - `agora_messages`, `issues`, `proposals`, `votes`: **Permanent**
  - `budget_usage`: 365 days
- [x] Scheduler integration (daily at 03:00)
- [x] Manual cleanup trigger via `triggerDataCleanup()`

#### Monitoring API Extension (P2) - COMPLETED
- [x] `GET /api/stats/llm-usage` - LLM usage by tier/provider, Tier 1 ratio, costs
- [x] `GET /api/stats/data-growth` - Row counts, daily averages, growth trends
- [x] `GET /api/stats/system-health` - Health score, error counts, budget status

## Running the Project

### Development Mode
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start both frontend and backend
pnpm dev

# Or start individually:
cd apps/api && pnpm dev   # Backend on :3201
cd apps/web && pnpm dev   # Frontend on :3200
```

### Production Mode (pm2)
```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start with pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs

# Management commands
pm2 status              # View status
pm2 logs algora-api     # API logs
pm2 logs algora-web     # Web logs
pm2 restart all         # Restart all
pm2 stop all            # Stop all

# Auto-start on reboot
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Production URLs
- **Production**: https://algora.moss.land

## Known Issues

1. Next.js 14.1.0 is outdated (minor warning)
2. Agent states not being persisted on server restart (need initialization)
3. Database requires re-initialization after schema changes (delete algora.db and run db:init)
4. Localhost CORS issues when connecting to production API (expected behavior)

---

## Environment Setup Notes

- Node.js v20.19.6
- pnpm (for monorepo)
- SQLite database stored in `apps/api/data/algora.db`
- Database auto-initializes on first run
- Ollama required for Tier 1 LLM (http://localhost:11434)

## For AI Assistants

When continuing development:
1. Read this file first to understand current status
2. Check CLAUDE.md for project context and guidelines
3. Run `git log --oneline -10` to see recent changes
4. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development servers (or `pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs` for production)
5. Update this file and CHANGELOG.md after significant changes
6. Update Korean translations (*.ko.md) when documentation changes

### Key Files to Know
- `ecosystem.config.cjs` - pm2 configuration
- `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` - Next.js i18n middleware (exclude `_next` paths)
- `apps/web/.env.local` - Frontend environment (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
- `apps/api/.env` - Backend environment

### Current Architecture
```
Internet → algora.moss.land (DNS)
        → Lightsail 13.209.131.190 (nginx + SSL)
        → Local 211.196.73.206 (pm2: api:3201, web:3200)
```
